# [Operator precedence][1]

All operators in Sidef have the same precedence, which is controlled by lack of whitespace between the operands.



For example:

```ruby
1+2 * 3+4    # means: (1+2) * (3+4)
```


See also the [documentation](https://trizen.gitbooks.io/sidef-lang/content/syntax_and_semantics/operator_precedence.html) on the precedence of operators.
