# [Hickerson series of almost integers][1]

```ruby
func h(n) {
    n! / (2 * pow(2.log, n+1))
}
 
{ |n|
    "h(%2d) = %22s is%s almost an integer.\n".printf(
        n, var hn = h(n).round(-3), hn.to_s ~~ /\.[09]/ ? '' : ' NOT')
} << 1..17
```

#### Output:
```
h( 1) =                  1.041 is almost an integer.
h( 2) =                  3.003 is almost an integer.
