# [Read entire file][1]

Reading an entire file as a string, can be achieved with the *FileHandle.slurp()* method, as illustrated bellow:

```ruby
var file = File(__FILE__)
var content = file.open_r.slurp
print content
```

Starting with version 2.30, *File.read()* can do the same:

```ruby
var file = File(__FILE__)
var content = file.read(:utf8)
print content
```
